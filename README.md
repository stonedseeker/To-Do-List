# To-Do-List
A simple TODO list made using EJS and Node
## How to Use
- CD into the cloned repository and `npm i`
- `node index.js` to run it 
## TODO
I am trying to find a way to host EJS files through git hub pages, even if its static, for this I put a yml file in the workflow section but it still doesn't work, just hosts the readme file : ' )
