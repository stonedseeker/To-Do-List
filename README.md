A simple TODO list made using EJS and Node
## How to Use
- CD into the cloned repository and `npm i`
- `node index.js` to run it 
## TODO
- I am currently using AWS Beanstalk service to host this, I think there might be a way to use github actions to host non static sited too, I have tried adding a yml file in the workflow, but it doesn't work.
- Its currently using a list to show the tasks, I want to use a json file to append new tasks.
- The deleting task button doesn't work ðŸ˜¬
